        I am a professor at Cornell University. My research focuses on algorithms and networks, the roles they play in
        large-scale social and information systems, and their broader societal implications. My work has been supported
        by an NSF Career Award, an ONR Young Investigator Award, a MacArthur Foundation Fellowship, a Packard Foundation
        Fellowship, a Simons Investigator Award, a Sloan Foundation Fellowship, a Vannevar Bush Faculty Fellowship, and
        grants from Facebook, Google, Yahoo, the MacArthur Foundation, the ARO, and the NSF. I am a member of the
        National Academy of Sciences, the National Academy of Engineering, and the American Academy of Arts and
        Sciences.

        <li>In Spring 2022, Karen Levy and I are teaching Choices and Consequences in Computing (INFO 1260 / CS 1340).
            The course is designed at an introductory level with no formal prerequisites, and covers a range of ethical,
            societal, and policy implications of computing and information.</li>

                <li><em>This book is based on an inter-disciplinary course that we teach entitled Networks. The book,

                        support deeper
                        explorations, most of the chapters are supplemented with optional advanced sections.</em></li>
